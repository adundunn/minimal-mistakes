I'm a New Zealand based computer science and information systems graduate with a passion for information security, specifically topics around penetration testing. I'm currently seeking a role to further develop my technical and business skills in the information security field.

All the while I'll be trying to learn as much as possible about the industry and the skills & tools I'll need to succeed. 

If I find something interesting or complete a project, I'll write about it.

Thanks for stopping by.

Aidan
